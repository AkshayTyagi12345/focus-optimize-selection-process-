Business challenge/requirementMotion Studios is the largest Radio production house in Europe.  Their total revenue $ 1B+. Company has launched a new reality show –"The Star RJ".  The show is about finding a new Radio Jockey who will be the star presenter onupcoming shows. In first round participants have to upload their voice clip online and the clip will be evaluated by experts for selection into the next round. There is a separate team inthe first round for evaluation of male and female voice. Response to the show is unprecedented and company is flooded with voice clips.You   have to classify the voice as either male/female so that first level of filtration is quicker.

Data volume-Approx 3000  records –file voice-classification.csv Fields in Data•meanfreq: mean frequency (in kHz)•sd: standard deviation of frequency•median: median frequency (in kHz)•Q25: first quantile (in kHz)•Q75: third quantile (in kHz)•IQR: interquantile range (in kHz)•skew: skewness (see note in specprop description)•kurt: kurtosis (see note in specpropdescription)•sp.ent: spectral entropy•sfm: spectral flatness•mode: mode frequency
centroid: frequency centroid (see specprop)•peakf: peak frequency (frequency with highest energy)•meanfun: average of fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal•minfun: minimum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal•maxfun: maximum fundamental frequency measured across acoustic signal•meandom: average of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal•mindom: minimum of dominant frequency measuredacross acoustic signal•maxdom: maximum of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal•dfrange: range of dominant frequency measured across acoustic signal•modindx: modulation index. Calculated as the accumulated absolute difference between adjacentmeasurements of fundamental frequencies divided by the frequency range•label: male or female
